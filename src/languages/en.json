I have extensive development experience with .NET technology and NodeJS be it either MVC or RESTful, I can also find my way around in Java, Scala and PHP. For frontend development I specialize in React with Typescript and also have some experience with Angular, but I find it easy to adapt to any other framework."

After a bit of research, I found that Hiragana and Katakana would be the easiest to learn. Sadly, I couldn't find any tools that could help me in the exact way as I wanted, which is by repeating them so often that you can't forget them even if you wanted to.",

The server-sided rendering is implemented for SEO optimization as the only search engine which can crawl a SPA without any problems, is Google. And as we don't want to limit our exposure to just Google, we want our SPA to display content before the Javascript is executed on the browser. To reduce loading times, all pages are generated once, and then cached by Nginx."
